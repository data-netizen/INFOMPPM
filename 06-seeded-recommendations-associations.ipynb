    "# ðŸ“š Recommendations based on Frequently Reviewed Together (association rules)\n",
    "For the final part of this assignment, you can turn to 5.4 in the Practical Recommender Systems book (pp 113-127). Read this chapter and [download](https://www.manning.com/downloads/1927) the code accompanied by the book. Explore `association_rules_calculator.py` in the `builder` directory and translate it to this notebook. Falk uses a different infrastructure, but it is pretty simple to adapt this code. We will provide some guidelines below to speed up the process.\n",
